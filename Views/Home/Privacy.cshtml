    <p class="lead">ClientSphere ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard the data you provide when using the ClientSphere Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system.</p>

        <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> IP addresses, browser type, and session data collected automatically to maintain system security.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the ClientSphere CRM platform and its features.</li>
        <li>To authenticate users and enforce role-based access controls.</li>
        <li>To generate reports, analytics, and dashboards within the system.</li>
        <li>To detect fraud, unauthorized access, or other security threats via audit logging.</li>
        <li>To communicate system-related updates, password resets, or important notices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h4>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell or share your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes. We may share data only in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Trusted partners that help us operate the system (e.g., payment processors, email delivery) under strict confidentiality agreements.</li>
