Project Objectives: 1. To develop a centralized Customer Master Data module that securely stores 
and manages complete customer information, including contact details, 
interaction history, and transaction records, to ensure accurate and 
consistent customer data shared across all system modules. 
2. To implement a Sales Management module that allows users to record sales 
transactions, manage client meeting schedules, and analyze performance, 
enabling the organization to identify trends and improve revenue 
management. 
3. To design a Customer Support and Service Module that centralizes client 
inquiries, complaints, and warranty claims. This module converts incoming 
requests into tracked "cases" or "tickets," enabling support staff to view the 
customer’s purchase history and resolve issues efficiently 
4. To integrate a Marketing Campaign Management module that supports the 
creation, monitoring, and evaluation of marketing campaigns, promotions, 
and customer engagement activities to help businesses improve customer 
retention and brand awareness. 
5. To develop a Billing and Invoice Integration module that automatically 
generates invoices from sales data, tracks customer payments, and 
maintains accurate billing records to reduce manual errors and improve 
financial transparency. 

Project Description: 
ClientSphere is a web -based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system 
designed for businesses focused on sales and customer service. It provides an all-
in-one platform to manage customer interactions and streamline business 
processes. Built with an Ent erprise Resource Planning (ERP) approach, 
ClientSphere integrates multiple business functions into a single centralized 
system using a shared database. The system includes five main modules: 
Customer Master Data, Sales Management, Customer Support and Tick eting, 
Marketing Campaign Management, and Billing and Invoice Management. 
The system is designed for different types of users, including administrators, sales 
teams, customer support staff, marketing teams, and billing personnel. Each user 
is granted access based on their role, ensuring data security and proper usage 
across departments. 
ClientSphere helps businesses overcome common challenges such as customer 
information being stored in multiple, disconnected locations, which can lead to 
duplicate records, errors, and delays. It also addresses inefficient sales tracking, 
slow support resp onses, unorganized marketing campaigns, and manual billing 
processes. By centralizing these functions, the system improves operational 
efficiency, ensures accurate data, enhances collaboration between departments, 
and increases overall customer satisfaction. 
To enhance functionality, the system integrates three key APIs. The Microsoft 
Graph API syncs sales schedules and meetings directly with staff Outlook 
calendars. An Email Notification API automates communication by sending 
updates for support tickets, billing reminders, and marketing campaigns. A 
Payment API helps confirm payment statuses and automatically updates billing 
and invoice records, ensuring accurate financial tracking. 
ClientSphere is built using modern web technologies, including ASP.NET Core for 
backend logic, SQL Server for database management, and responsive web 
technologies for the interface. These technologies were chosen for their 
reliability, security, and ability to support scalable, enterprise-level applications. 
Overall, ClientSphere  provides businesses with a powerful, ERP -based CRM 
solution that improves decision-making, strengthens customer relationships, and 
enhances overall business performance.

Agile Model - 
SDLC 
The ClientSphere Customer Relationship Management System follows the Agile Software 
Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to ensure flexibility, continuous improvement, and 
effective collaboration among stakeholders. During the Requirements and Planning phase, 
the development team identifies the core needs of the system based on the roles involved, 
such as Admin, Sales Staff, Support Staff, Marketing Staff, and Customers. The primary goal 
of the system is to provide an organized platform for managing customer data, tracking 
sales, handling support tickets, running marketing campaigns, and generating invoices, all 
with proper role-based access. 
 
In this phase, the major functional requirements were gathered through system analysis 
and use-case identification. These include customer management (add/edit/delete/view), 
sales tracking, support ticket creation and resolution, marketing campaign managem ent, 
invoice generation, and reporting. The planning process also defines the project scope, 
prioritizes features into Agile iterations or sprints, and ensures that each role has the 
correct permissions within the system. 
By applying Agile planning, the system is developed incrementally, allowing feedback and 
improvements after every sprint to ensure the final software meets the needs of both 
management and operational users, while enhancing efficiency in customer relations hip 
processes.
