     The Login Page enables internal corporate personnel to securely access the system using 
their assigned account credentials. Employee accounts are pre-registered and managed by 
the Super Administrator or HR/Admin, ensuring that only authorized users can log in to the 
platform. Upon entering a valid username and password, the system authenticates the 
user’s identity and grants access based on their designated role within the organization, 
such as Employee, Project Manager, Department Head, HR/Admin, Executive , or Super 
Admin. This role-based authentication ensures that users are directed to the appropriate 
dashboard and are only able to access features and data relevant to their responsibilities. 
In cases of invalid login credentials, the system displays an error message prom pting the 
user to provide correct login information.

Dashboard

     The Employee Dashboard serves as the primary interface for employees to access and 
manage their assigned tasks and project -related responsibilities within the system. It 
provides an overview of ongoing projects, assigned tasks, deadlines, and project updates 
relevant to the employee’s role. Through this dashboard, employees can track the progress 
of their tasks, view project details, and stay informed about notifications such as new 
assignments, task updates, or project announcements. Additionally, it allows employees to 
collaborate within project workflows by participating in assigned activities and monitoring 
their individual contributions to the overall project lifecycle. This feature ensures that 
employees remain updated and actively engaged in project e xecution and organizational 
workflow processes.

Update/Edit 
Page

     The Edit Proposal  page provides a dedicated interface for employees to modify and 
refine their submitted project proposals. This page allows users to update the project title 
and use a rich text editor to expand upon the project's description, objectives, and 
workflows—such as the "Digital Employee Onboarding Automation System" shown in the 
interface. 
 
     By offering tools for text formatting and file attachments (supporting images, PDFs, and 
documents up to 10 MB), the page ensures that proposals can be presented with 
professional clarity and supporting documentation. The inclusion of a "Versions" feature 
allows employees to track historical changes, while the "Save Changes" functionality 
ensures that updates are synchronized with the system’s central database. This interface is 
critical for maintaining the accuracy of project documentation and allowing for  iterative 
improvements to proposals before they move through the organizational approval 
lifecycle.

Archive

     The Archive functionality within the Proposals module serves as a critical organizational 
tool, allowing employees to manage the visibility and lifecycle of their submissions. By 
utilizing the archive filter and the dedicated archive action icon located in the propos al 
table, users can transition inactive, completed, or outdated proposals out of their primary 
workspace. 
 
     This feature provides a structured way to declutter the "My Proposals" list without 
permanently deleting records, ensuring that historical data—such as submission dates, past 
statuses (e.g., Approved or Rejected), and associated documents—remains accessible for 
future reference or audits. Through the archive toggle and status filters, employees can 
seamlessly switch between viewing active projects and archived entries, maintaining an 
efficient and focused environment for current project execution.

Display Records  
(Screenshot) 
 
 
 
 
     The My Proposals page features a structured Display Records interface that provides a 
comprehensive overview of all project proposals authored by the employee. This 
centralized table is designed for high scannability, allowing users to monitor their 
submission history and current progress at a glance. Each record i n the display includes 
several critical fields, such as the full Project Title, an Input Preview that highlights snippets 
of the proposal’s core content or attached filenames, the specific Date Submitted, and a 
color-coded Status badge indicating whether the item is Pending, Approved, Rejected, or 
Requires Revision. 
 
     To maintain an organized workspace, the interface is supported by dynamic 
management tools, including a global search bar and dropdown menus that allow users to 
filter records by their active or archived state. Furthermore, a dedicated Action column 
provides immediate access to view, edit, or archive individual entries, while pagination 
controls ensure that large sets of data remain easy to navigate. This systematic display of 
records ensures that employees can efficiently manage their professional contributions and 
stay informed about the lifecycle of their organizational proposals.

Database – SQL 
Server (Local) 
Screenshot 
 
 
 
     The Database module for the proposal system is powered by SQL Server (Local) , 
providing a robust and structured relational storage environment for all project -related 
data. Utilizing Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), administrators and 
developers can manage the project_lifecycle_db database, which serves as the central 

repository for critical system information. The core of this storage is the ProjectProposals 
table, which systematically records essential attributes for every submission, including 
unique identifiers like the EmployeeId, the project Title, and the detailed Input content. 
 
     Furthermore, the database handles lifecycle and organizational metadata by storing the 
DateCreated, the current Status (such as Pending, Approved, or Rejected), and 
departmental links through the DepartmentHeadId field. It also features built -in logic for 
content management, such as a Note field for feedback and a bit-based IsArchived column, 
which directly controls whether a record appears in the active or archived view on the 
employee dashboard. By maintaining this detailed schema, the SQL Server backend ensures 
data integrity, supports complex filtering across different proposal versions, and facilitates 
seamless synchronization between the user interface and the persistent storage layer.

     The Database infrastructure is hosted in a Deployed/Online environment through 
MonsterASP.net, providing a high -availability cloud solution for the project lifecycle 
system. This online implementation utilizes a remote MSSQL instance, identified as 
db41083.databaseasp.net, which mirrors the local schema to ensure seamless data 
transitions between development and production. Through the MonsterASP.net 
management interface, administrators can monitor real-time database statistics, including 
row counts, storage sizes, and precise timestamps for the last modification of table data. 
 
     The cloud database maintains the integrity of the organizational hierarchy and project 
workflows by hosting several critical tables, including User and Role Management  tables 
such as AspNetUsers and AspNetRoles for secure access, as well as Organizational Structure 
tables like Departments and Employees to facilitate proposal routing. The Project and 
Proposal Lifecycle  is meticulously tracked through the ProjectProposals and 
ProjectProposalVersions tables, while specific execution data is managed via Projects, 
ProjectTasks, and ProjectMilestones. Additionally, Administrative Tracking  is handled 
through tables like ProposalNoteVersions and ProjectManagers. This cloud -based 
deployment ensures that all project data remains synchronized and accessible to remote 
users, providing a scalable backbone for the organization’s digital transformation efforts.
